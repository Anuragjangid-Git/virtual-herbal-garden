## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users visit the web UI and input queries about a herb.
2. **API Request**: The query is sent to the backend service via Axios.
3. **AI Processing**: The Spring Boot backend routes the request to the Gemini API with a curated prompt template.
4. **Data Handling**: Responses are either generated live or fetched from Firebase if previously queried.
5. **UI Rendering**: The frontend displays structured insights with categories like:
   - Uses
   - Benefits
   - Growing Conditions
   - Precautions (if applicable)
